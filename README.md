# Pokefinder web project !

This project asks user for the name of a pokemon, and consumes the https://pokeapi.co/ API in order to retrieve their information and display it on the web!

It's a web-app developed on ReactJS and consuming specific libraries such as:

- Chakra UI
- Redux
- TypeScript

In order to run this web-app, clone this public repository on your localhost running the following line on the command line interface:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rioscris/pokefinder.git
```

Next, move on to the recently created folder, which contains the cloned project:

```bash
cd ./pokefinder
cd ./pokefinder-app
```

Now, run the following lines to install `npm` dependencies and run the project on `localhost`!

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

That should allow the project to run!

#### Notes: 
#### - This project is an activity for FlyDevs recruitment process.
#### - As of now, the project is not fully finished, as the pokemon display is still quite incomplete and needs to be finished. This will be a new version in master!
